From the i3lock pkg-descr:

    i3lock improves slock by making it fork() and therefore combinable with
    commands to suspend your computer. Additionally, instead of turning off
    your screen via DPMS and/or displaying a black screen, i3lock displays
    a white screen so you can see if your computer failed to resume from
    suspend or if your screen is just locked. Also, when entering a wrong
    password, i3lock does not call XBell(). This is important because
    i3lock/slock think you have entered a password when resuming from
    suspend, at least sometimes.

    i3lock was forked from slock-0.9

i3lock-color forks i3lock and adds support for color options for verification
ring, backspace highlight color, key highlight color, etc., blurring the
current screen and using that as the lock background, showing a clock in the
indicator, and more.
